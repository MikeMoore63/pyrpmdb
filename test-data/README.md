# This directory has valid package database to test against plenty of other files to test errors against around.

These all work as is bar the sqlite I see json unmarshal errors when opening the database on osx.

But all of berkley db seem to work fine so cbl-mariner and fedora are imapcted as they changed to this.

RedHat, Rocky etc though are all still as writing on berkley db.
